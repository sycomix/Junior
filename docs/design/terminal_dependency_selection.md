# Terminal Dependency Selection

After thorough evaluation, we've decided to go with `xterm.js` for the frontend terminal emulation. Here are the reasons:

- **Lightweight**: `xterm.js` is lightweight and doesn't come with unnecessary bloat.
- **WebSocket Support**: It can seamlessly integrate with WebSockets, which we already have in place.
- **Active Community**: The library is actively maintained and has a strong community.

On the backend, we will use our existing WebSocket server to execute commands sent from the frontend and return the results.

## Implementation Steps:

1. Install `xterm.js` via npm.
2. Integrate `xterm.js` into the frontend application.
3. Use the existing WebSocket to send commands from the frontend to the backend.
4. On the backend, execute these commands and send back the output via the WebSocket.
