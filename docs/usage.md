# Developing External Projects with Junior

## Installation

Install Junior globally by running the following command:

```
npm install -g @aijunior/dev
```
Additionally, you can install the "Junior" vscode extension from the vscode extension marketplace.

## Initialization

Navigate to the project directory where you want to work with Junior and initialize the necessary files with the command:

```
junior-init
```

This will create the following files:

```
.gitignore
prompt/projectSpecifics.md
prompt.yaml
```

The Task Interaction Files (TIF) will be gitignored:
  - `prompt.yaml`, the prompt descriptor filled by the user ([descriptor.md](./descriptor.md))
  - `prompt.md`, the generated prompt by Junior
  - `change.sh`, the changeset generated by the language model

### Project Specifics

`prompt/projectSpecifics.md` is used to provide instructions about the codebase that Junior is working on, like preferred tools. It is important to keep this file minimal as it will be included in most prompts, and unnecessary complexity may result in the language model losing track and failing to solve the task.

## Starting Junior

Start Junior within your project directory with:

```
junior-web
```
