# Working set

./src/frontend/App.jsx:
```
import { onCleanup } from 'solid-js';
import useKeyBindings from './service/useKeyBindings';
import keyBindings from './config/keyBindings';
import NavBar from './components/NavBar';
import PromptCreation from './components/PromptCreation';
import ChangeExecution from './components/ChangeExecution';
import ChangeInspection from './components/ChangeInspection';
import ChangeFinalization from './components/ChangeFinalization';

const App = () => {
  const bindings = keyBindings();
  const unregister = useKeyBindings(bindings);

  onCleanup(unregister); 

  return (
    <div class="bg-main min-h-screen max-w-desktop lg:max-w-desktop md:max-w-full sm:max-w-full xs:max-w-full mx-auto flex flex-col items-center space-y-8 px-2 sm:px-4 xs:px-4 pb-8">
      <NavBar />
      <PromptCreation />
      <ChangeExecution />
      <ChangeInspection />
      <ChangeFinalization />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

```

# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!

Requirements:

Lower the space between items in the app to space-y-4


## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function or signal*! eg.: in createGitRepo.js: export function createGitRepo ( ....
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs* and Tailwind, edit .jsx files accordingly!

# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Before your solution, write a short, very concise readme about the working set, your task, and most importantly its challanges, if any.


EXAMPLE START
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 9 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
cat > x.js << 'EOF'
[...]
'EOF'
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
EXAMPLE END

Before starting, check if you need more files or info to solve the task.

If the task is not clear:

EXAMPLE START
I need more information to solve the task. [Description of the missing info]
EXAMPLE END

Do not edit files not provided in the working set!
If you need more files:

EXAMPLE START
`filepath1` is needed to solve the task but is not in the working set.
EXAMPLE END
